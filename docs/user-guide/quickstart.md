2. Connect different [blocks'](https://github.com/pingcap/LinguFlow) imports and exports, ensuring data types match for a successful connection.
3. After completing the application's connections, click the [`Debug` button](https://github.com/pingcap/LinguFlow) to test the application.
4. Click `Save` to store this version.

## API Call Your Application
