# Tracing

LinguFlow integrates with [Langfuse Cloud](https://langfuse.com/) to provide tracing capabilities.

## Setting Keys

When creating an [application](../develop/application_and_version), you have the option to input specific `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` and `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` for a Langfuse Cloud project. By entering the correct keys, tracing data will be transmitted to Langfuse Cloud during both debugging and production use of the application.

## Viewing Tracing Data

To view tracing data, simply access Langfuse Cloud and utilize its Tracing feature to examine detailed results. This functionality allows for in-depth analysis and monitoring of your application's performance and behavior, facilitating troubleshooting and optimization efforts.
